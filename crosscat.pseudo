Create Beta Priors for each possible combination (ROWS by COLUMNS)

OR

Create a number of beta priors that move around and are attached to columns

THis becomes real beta hyperparameters hooked up through a beta distribution to the data elements through a multiplexer.

Therefore, we could either hook up the hyperparameters with a hard equals or a soft equals I suppose.

Hyperparameters go to a particular
